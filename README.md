Welcome to MuckRaker

This small app was inspired by a lecture example at the Flatiron School. We were getting an introdution to JS Events. I liked the interaction of creating an emoji list and implementing a click to remove. I thought a bit of extra JS could turn the simple exercise into a simple game. Enter MuckRaker: An Emoji Poop-cleaning Game.

The CSS and HTML are for the most part lifted from the original exercise, while the JavaScript is my own. I am particularly proud of the feature by which the navigation button decides how large to make the playing field. Try resizing your browser and then regenerating a playing field using the 'Muck It Up' button. 

Check out lines 27 to 37 of 'index.js' to learn the gameplay and win conditions for MuckRaker. Thanks for taking a look at this project!
